Welcome to Wordle+. This is a re-creation of the popular game Wordle, where you will be given a randomly generated word and you will have to guess that word given a certain number of lives in order to win.
Letters that are guessed correctly in the exact spot are highlighted green. Letters that are guessed correctly but in the incorrect spot are highlighted yellow. Letters that are not included are highlighted gray.
Each guess must also be a valid word--you cannot enter random letters. There are several gamemodes, which can be chosen from the gamemodes menu. Settings can also be tweaked to your liking in the settings menu.
